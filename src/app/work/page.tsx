                        At Queer Youth Group (QYG), our commitment to advancing the rights and dignity of queer individuals in Nepal is realized through a multifaceted approach. We actively engage in several key areas to foster a more equitable, just, and inclusive society for all gender and sexual minorities.

                                Gender-Affirmative Healthcare

                                <p className="my-2">
                                    Gender-affirmative healthcare is fundamental to the well-being and self-actualization of transgender and gender-diverse individuals. This essential care encompasses a range of social, psychological, behavioral, or medical interventions, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), to support and affirm an individual's gender identity. This can include Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), various feminization or masculinization surgeries (e.g., facial, voice), body hair removal/growth, and reconstructive surgeries. We recognize that the absence of such care can lead to gender dysphoria. QYG is committed to policy reform to ensure access to gender-affirmative healthcare in Nepal.

                                    Language plays a crucial role in affirming identity and ensuring dignity. QYG champions the linguistic rights of People of Marginalized Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Sex Characteristics (PoMSOGIESC), also known as gender and sexual minorities. Our work in this area focuses on:

                                    Including inclusive terms and their definitions in the Nepali official dictionary.
                                    Establishing proper language for the identity of transgender people.
                                    Advocating for legal provisions against the misgendering of trans and gender-diverse individuals.

                                    QYG actively campaigns for the rights of PoMSOGIESC by engaging with government agencies. We advocate for crucial legal and administrative reforms through:

                                    Formal requests for consultations.
                                    Providing comments on policy drafts that directly affect our community.
